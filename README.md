### 📷 Script to Fix Media File Timestamps Based on Associated JSON Metadata  
**Author:** SoggyCow

---

## 🧠 Overview
This PowerShell script traverses a directory recursively, identifying supported media files (images and videos) and matching them to nearby `.json` metadata files—typically generated by Google Photos exports or similar services. If a matching JSON contains a valid `photoTakenTime` timestamp, the script updates the media file's **CreationTime** and **LastWriteTime** accordingly to reflect when the photo or video was originally taken.

---

## 📂 Supported Media Formats
- `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.bmp`
- `.mp4`, `.mov`, `.gif`, `.webm`, `.3gpp`, `.3gp`, `.webp`, `.heic`

---

## 🔍 How Matching Works
- Uses the **base name** of each media file, escapes special characters, and compares with JSON file names using wildcard and fuzzy logic.
- Falls back to listing potential JSON matches if an exact pair isn't found.
- Errors are gracefully logged, ensuring robust traversal of even messy directories.

---

## 🛠️ Key Features
- Recursively processes nested folders
- Smart filtering: excludes `.html`, `.ps1`, `.zip`, and unlisted media extensions
- Parses Unix timestamps from JSON and converts them to system-local time
- Updates timestamps only when valid data is present—no blind overwrites

---

## ⚙️ Requirements
- Windows PowerShell
- Valid JSON metadata files with a `photoTakenTime.timestamp` field

---

## 🚀 Usage
Run the script in the directory containing your media and JSON files:

```powershell
.\Fix_Dates.ps1
