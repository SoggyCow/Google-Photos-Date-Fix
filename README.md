## Overview

This PowerShell script recursively scans a directory for supported media files (images and videos) and pairs them with corresponding `.json` metadata files, such as those exported from Google Photos. If a matching JSON file contains a valid `photoTakenTime` timestamp, the script updates the media fileâ€™s **CreationTime** and **LastWriteTime** to reflect the original capture date.

## Supported Media Formats

- Images: `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.bmp`, `.webp`, `.heic`
- Videos: `.mp4`, `.mov`, `.gif`, `.webm`, `.3gpp`, `.3gp`

## Matching Logic

- Matches media files to JSON files using their **base name**, escaping special characters for robust pairing.
- Employs wildcard and fuzzy logic to handle naming variations.
- Lists potential JSON matches if no exact pair is found.
- Logs errors gracefully to ensure reliable processing of complex directory structures.

## Features

- Recursively processes nested folders.
- Filters out irrelevant files (e.g., `.html`, `.ps1`, `.zip`) and unsupported media extensions.
- Converts Unix timestamps from JSON to system-local time.
- Updates timestamps only when valid data is present, preventing unintended overwrites.

## Requirements

- Windows PowerShell
- JSON metadata files containing a `photoTakenTime.timestamp` field
- Read/write access to the target directory

## Usage

Run the script in the directory containing your media and JSON files:

```powershell
.\Fix_Dates.ps1
```

## Technical Notes

- **Error Handling**: Gracefully logs errors to maintain stability in messy directories.
- **Timestamp Conversion**: Parses Unix timestamps and adjusts to local system time.
- **Testing**: Test in a sandbox or backup your files before running to avoid unintended changes.
